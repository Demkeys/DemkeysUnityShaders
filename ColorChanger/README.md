## Color Changer shader ##

This is shader changes the colors of the texture in fragment shader. For each color channel, you can choose to Switch, Add, Subtract, Multiply or Divide it's value with the R, G, B or A channel's value. After these calculations are done, you can additionally choose to Add, Subtract, Multiply or Divide the result with another color. This shader is meant to be used as a debugging shader, so for example, if you wanna see what a certain model would look like with different colored textures, you can use this shader to test out different color schemes, rather than repainting and attaching a new texture for a different color scheme. That being said, the shader can be used as is, to change the color of your textures, if you wish to do so.
